## Code Book

The run_analysis.R script performs the data preparation and then followed by the 5 steps required as described in the course projectâ€™s definition

# Download the dataset

Dataset downloaded and is extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset

# All dimension of Datas

x_train contains 7352 obs and 561 variables

x_test contains 2947 obs and 561 variables

y_train contains 7352 obs and 1 variable

y_test contains 2947 obs and 1 variable

subject train contains 7352 obs and 1 variable

subject_test contains 2947 obs and 1 variable

mrg_test, which is the merged data of all test dataset contains 2947 obs and 563 variables

mrg_train, which is the merged data of all test dataset contains 7352 obs anb 563 variables

MergedData is the the merged data of both mrg_test and mrg_train, which contains 10299 obs and 563 variable

mean_and_SD_data is created by subsetting MergedData, selecting only columns: subjectID, activityID and the measurements on the mean and standard deviation (std) for each measurement and it contains 10299 obs abd 81 variables

FinalData (180 rows, 88 columns) is created by sumarizing mean_and_SD_Data taking the means of each variable for each activityID and each subjectID, after groupped by subjectID and activityID.
